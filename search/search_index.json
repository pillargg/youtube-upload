Getting a youtube api key First, you need to go to this website . If prompted, select a project, or create a new one. Use the Library page to find and enable the YouTube Data API v3. Go to the credentials page . Click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID . Select the Web application app type. Fill in the form and click create. For testing redirect URIs that refer to the local machine with http://localhost:8080 . Download the client_secret.json file from the API Console and securely store the file in a location that only your application can access. By default, the application gets this file from the directory your script is being ran in. The path can also be changed when the class YouTubeUploader is being initialized. Get your client_id and client_secret . We recommend that you design your app's auth endpoints so that your application does not expose authorization codes to other resources on the page. The key must have the scope 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload'. Usage Info The variables client_id and client_secret are how Google identify your application. These are specified in the initialization parameters or in the client_secrets.json file. The variables access_token and refresh_token are how Google's APIs differentiate between different YouTube channels. These are specified in the authenticate method.

Usage 0. Importing the package # youtube upload api from youtube_upload.client import YouTubeUploader 1. Instantiating an uploader uploader = YoutubeUploader(client_id,client_secret) or uploader = YoutubeUploader() If a client_secrets.json is present in the current working directory (downloaded from the Credentials Control Panel in the Google Cloud Console when you create the application). or uploader = YoutubeUploader(secrets_file_path=secrets_file_path_here) You can specify the path to the file with the secrets_file_path parameter. 2. Authentication If you run authenticate with no parameters and no oauth.json , it opens a web page locally that you can use to sign into the YouTube Channel you want to upload the video to. uploader.authenticate() or uploader.authenticate(access_token=access_token_here, refresh_token=refresh_token_here) OR uploader.authenticate(oauth_path='oauth.json') 3.

If you do not pass the variables in, the class will look for a client_secrets.json file in the same direction in which the script is being initialized.

If you give no path, the method will look for the oauth.json file in the current working directory.

You can also add a callback function for the case where the upload were to fail. This is mainly for custom error handling and prompting users to re-authenticate. The callback function is the parameter noauth_callback . The function passed should be able to accept a tuple of arguments. The parameter noauth_args is the arguments for the function. Here is an example of the callback function being used. from youtube_upload.client import YoutubeUploader def callback(*args): print(args[0], args[1]) with YoutubeUploader() as youtube: youtube.authenticate() youtube.upload(\"test.mp4\", noauth_callback=callback, noauth_args=(\"It failed.\")) And here is the example output in the case that the upload would fail.
